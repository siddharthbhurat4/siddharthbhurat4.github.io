* I successfully defined and linearized the quadcopterâ€™s dynamics, and evaluated its stability. 
* Further-more, implemented two distinct controllers - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control(MPC) - both of which demonstrated proficiency in trajectory  tracking. 
* Lastly, by adding constraints to the MPC and integrating the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to LQR, was able to create collision free paths and demonstrated the capability of the controllers to effectively avoid obstacles.
