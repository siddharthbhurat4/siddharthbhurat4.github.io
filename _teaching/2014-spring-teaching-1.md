# Graduate Student Instructor for Robotic Systems Lab


* Course Code - ROB550 <span style="float:right;">August 2023 â€“ April 2024</span>

I served as a Student Instructor for the Robotic Systems Lab course, guiding students through the exploration, conceptualization, and implementation of a robotic arm-based pick-and-place application. This multifaceted project encompassed fundamental tasks such as forward and inverse kinematics, computer vision-based object detection, and automatic camera calibration.

Additionally, I played a pivotal role in mentoring students as they embarked on the development of an autonomous mobile robot from scratch. This project delved into various core concepts, including sensor interfacing, sensor fusion techniques, PID and particle filters implementation, and the creation of a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) stack. My assistance extended to guiding students in applying these concepts to develop a sophisticated computer vision-based warehouse automation application using the autonomous mobile robot.

Throughout both projects, my aim was to facilitate a deep understanding of theoretical concepts while ensuring practical implementation skills. I fostered an interactive learning environment, encouraging students to not only grasp the intricacies of robotics but also to develop problem-solving skills crucial for real-world applications.
